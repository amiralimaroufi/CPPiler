# CPPiler

## Overview

CPPiler is a simple compiler project written in Python that demonstrates basic compiler construction techniques. This project is designed to help developers understand the fundamental concepts of **lexical analysis**, **parsing**, and **code generation**. The compiler currently supports a subset of the C++ language and can be extended to include more features.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis**:  
  The compiler includes a lexical analyzer (lexer) that tokenizes the input source code.

- **Parsing**:  
  The project features a recursive descent parser that constructs an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** from the tokens generated by the lexer.

- **Code Generation**:  
  The compiler generates intermediate code (or target code) from the AST.

- **Error Handling**:  
  Basic error handling is implemented to provide meaningful error messages during the compilation process.
